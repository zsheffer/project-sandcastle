## Alexandria

Alexandria uses the content and context of news stories to analyze the information in real time and provide a sentiment analysis. Using probabilistic algorithms developed from a concept-based, non-linear statistical methodology of testing finance professionals, Alexandria has the ability to model complex dependencies between various words of semantic information, which helps it better identify sentiment than standard rules-based approaches. Sentiment data over a certain period is aggregated into a log net sentiment metric, which can then be compared with other companies in the market. Alexandria prefers to deliver their data in CSV format over FTP.

**Example Usage**
- Market sentiment analysis

## Factset

Factset contains similar data to Bloomberg, but makes it more easily available (and cheaper) by delivering it as CSV through FTP. 

** Example Usage**
- pricing and fundamental data 

## SIX Financial

SIX Financial offers reference data on corporate actions and price information from a compilation of over 1,500 sources globally. Pricing and market information is drawn in real-time, along with data on fixed income and dividends. For fixed income and derivative securities that are not quoted, SIX uses a internal pricing system to price securities four times per day. 

**Example Usage**
- Fixed income and corporate actions
- Pricing of non-quoted securities
- Index pricing

## Thompson Reuters

Thompson Reuters provides access to thousands of fundamental data points from the three main financial statements and beyond. Information includes typical standardized financial data such as earnings, dividends, and margins, but also contains sector specific data such as business and geographic segments, operating information (business intelligence), and major customers. TR prefers to deliver their data through an online SOAP-based API or XML structured files via FTP.  

**Example Usage**
- Fundamental data and price information
